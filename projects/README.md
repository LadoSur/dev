Generative Music
---

### Status

Have a rudimentary song generator at [familiar-synths.js](https://github.com/abetusk/dev/blob/release/notes/src/familiar-synths.js).

The song still isn't quite to my liking as all tunes it generates still sound "same-y".

Gibber (alpha playground) is still having problems with some of the presets, so the preset/instrument library
that can be drawn on is pretty limited.

### todo

* figure out how to make some reasonable generative synths instead of relying on presets
* remove drums at end so they stop
* find instrument sound levels with each other so they play well with each other
* add extra effects (pads, background texture, more complex beats/rythms) to score to help flesh it out
* figure out why the songs sound so stale

### Status

Boards is generated but unordered and the test is unassembled.

### todo

* test out with a nano/arduino with a CR2032 cell to see you can vibrate the motor
* order boards
* create software for it

Live Free, Live Forever

### Status

Jacket is assembled but the backing board needs to be paired down.

If there's some way to make the backing easier, this would be ideal.

### todo

* either cut the backing board smaller or figure out another mounting method
* create a case for the electronics etc (3d print it)

BLDC Driver

### Status

Boards are ordered but need to be soldered and tested

### todo

* solder boards
* test on a motor

Seg16
---

### Status

Have a set of 10 boards (put on Tindie) but without a good
method for the diffusors.

The diffusors are laser cut from EVA foam but maybe they
would be better served by 3d printing them.
Seems like kind of a waste of material but who knows.

### todo

* create a clock out of them (or something) as a standalone project

Bloom3d
---

### Status

The 3d printing solution I was pursuing is not going to work.

I think a better method is to have cloth/Tyvek hinges sandwiched in between
laser cut/3d printed/whatever thin strips which then go to a central shaft.

### todo

* investigate shaft and joint mechanism

* stand up node and play around with it

### Status

Software is mostly created, though it needs to be tested a bit.

### todo

* run some outdoor tests on the solar + battery to discover feasibility

Music Similarity
---

### Status

Highly speculative, need to research more.

A modification to `sox` to allow for logarithm frequency spectrogram [here](http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.com/2014/02/sox-spectrogram-log-frequency-axis-and.html) ([gh](https://github.com/jdesbonnet/joe-desbonnet-blog/blob/master/projects/sox-log-spectrogram/spectrogram.c)).

### todo

* find a workflow to create spectrogram, output some type of constellation map
* go back from constellation map to sound to see what gets picked up
